# Huffman-Coding-Project
In this project I implement compression algorithm, "Huffman Coding", in C++ . Goal is to reduce the size of a text file after conversion and to retrieve the original file further.

Successfully compressed a 546 KB file "test.txt" to a 294 KB filr "Compressed.bin" which is about 46% reduction in size.
Also managed to retrieve the original 546 KB file as "Retrieved.txt"
